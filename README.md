# App Bootstrap 

This project is just a basic bootstrapped server/frontend.  It uses node.js and koa on the back, and create react app on the front.

It serves as a personal starting point for my future projects.



## Start the Server

In the backend directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app, likely on localhost:3001.

## Start the Frontend

In the frontend directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the frontend, likely on localhost:3000.
